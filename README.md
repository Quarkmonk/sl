# Welcome to the HEM Sound Library.

The HEM Sound Library (HEM SL) is an open-source collection of sound samples in WAV and Ableton Live format.

HEM SL contains many beautiful instrument-based sounds and textures, ready for use in any genre of music.
It also contains some rather more curious artefacts like [studio outtakes](http://google.com), [noise reduction artefacts](),
[condenser mic feedback](), [no-input mixer](), and [secondhand-store vinyl]().

HEM SL also includes generative sample playback engine for Ableton Live.
