# HEM Sound Library

HEM Sound Library is an open-source collection of sound samples and generative music tools for Ableton Live.

!["Picture of the wind chime."](Misc/readme/chime.gif "Picture of the wind chime.")

This Sound Library contains 30 sample packs containing over 1800 samples of traditional instruments, extended technique, microtonality, spectralism, non-cochlear events, conceptual sound, studio outtakes, noise reduction artefacts, no-input mixer, rare synth units, secondhand-store vinyl, etc., plus a generative sample playback engine called "Seurat MIDI".

You can browse and hear actual presets at [HEM](https://hem.rocks/sl), or by playing the mp3 samples directly from this repository, under "Sounds". Find something you like, download the `.alp` file, and start working immediately in Ableton Live. Follow the tutorials to more about using the library in your own work. To contribute to the library, see below.

# Tutorials

## 1) MIDI Pointilism: Seurat MIDI

Seurat is a general-purpose tool to explore large numbers of samples, and to create textures out of them. It does this by "spraying" MIDI notes around on your sample set.  This is likened to how Georges Seurat painted with dots. Try tutorial #2 "MIDI Pointilism" to see how Seurat works. (Seurat MIDI does not require Max for Live.)

## 2) Follow-action Wind Chime

Once you've found a bunch of presets for Seurat, render them out as clips. Then use random follow actions to find complex ideas for compositions.

## 3) Live Rig

Gather all your Seurat presets together and consolidate, then drop them from the browser onto a track, and tweak their settings at will. One cool live performance trick is to have a few Seurat instances with throttle set to almost zero, leading to huge gaps of silence and rare alternating accents for your main part(s).

## 4) Capture and Edit

Complete a finished track by capturing the MIDI output of Seurat and perfecting the device's performance.

# History
