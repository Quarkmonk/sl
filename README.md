!["Picture of the wind chime."](Misc/readme/chime.gif "Picture of the wind chime.")

This Sound Library contains 30 sample packs containing over 1800 samples of traditional instruments, extended technique, microtonality, spectralism, non-cochlear events, conceptual sound, studio outtakes, noise reduction artefacts, no-input mixer, rare synth units, secondhand-store vinyl, etc., plus a generative sample playback engine for Ableton Live, called "Seurat MIDI".

## Getting Started

You can browse preset textures at [HEM's sample browser](https://hem.rocks/sl), or by playing the mp3 samples directly from this repository, under "Sounds". Find something you like, download the `.alp` file, and start working immediately in Ableton Live. Click here for full documentation. To contribute to the library, see below.

!["The album cover."](Misc/readme/dd-cover.jpg "The album cover.")

The "Demonstration Disc" is the best way to see what the library is fully capable of. It is also the first full–length album made with the Sound Library. Starting on 22nd of October, you can get it here in its entirety, including Ableton project files, by checking it out of Github.

__It's highly encouraged that you listen on iTunes, Spotify, or purchase a physical copy from RedEye distribution.__

Press Release:

      "Demonstration Disc" is, ostensibly, a new album by Jason Grier; equally so, it’s a quickstart guide to the sonic offerings in the open-sourced collection of samples and generative music tools which Grier spent the past 3 years carving, cutting, and coding from bespoke studio recordings and wayward sonic data.

      Issues of labor theory, social practice, and sonic activism pervade an abstract surface worked and re-worked toward a hallucinatory depth of field.

      Sounds range from the [lush psychoacoustic, for example, gossamer threads], to the [antique piano, demonstration of failed equipment], labor artefacts, to the extra-cochlear [ex, ex, trump protests].

      Loud, decadent, irreverent, and cinematic, "Demonstration Disc" sounds like mashing down all the preset buttons on your sparkling-new, cosmic-avant-garde monster synth, with delectable aplomb.

# Tutorials

## 1) MIDI Pointilism: Seurat MIDI

Seurat is a general-purpose tool to explore large numbers of samples, and to create textures out of them. It does this by "spraying" MIDI notes around on your sample set.  This is likened to how Georges Seurat painted with dots. Try tutorial #2 "MIDI Pointilism" to see how Seurat works. Seurat MIDI does not require Max for Live.

## 2) Follow-action Wind Chime

## 3) Capture and Edit

## 4) Live Rig

# History

HEM SL was recorded and developed by Jason Grier between 2013 and 2017. It has been the  mainstay of his live performances since 2013, and is now available for public use.
