"Demonstration Disc" is, ostensibly, a new album by Jason Grier; equally so, itâ€™s a quickstart guide to the sonic offerings in the open-sourced collection of samples and generative music tools which Grier spent the past 3 years carving, cutting, and coding from bespoke studio recordings and wayward sonic data.

Issues of labor theory, social practice, and sonic activism pervade an abstract surface worked and re-worked toward a hallucinatory depth of field.

Sounds range from the [lush psychoacoustic, for example, gossamer threads], to the [antique piano, demonstration of failed equipment], labor artefacts, to the extra-cochlear [ex, ex, trump protests].

Loud, decadent, irreverent, and cinematic, "Demonstration Disc" sounds like mashing down all the preset buttons on your sparkling-new, cosmic-avant-garde monster synth, with delectable aplomb.
